**jrdutra/jrdutra** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

#### DroneEnv 

A Flutter application to show the weather forecast for Drone flights. You can access the repository [here](https://github.com/jrdutra/droneenv).
The first stage is to develop the Flutter app for the frontend and latter the backend using the spring framework with the Java language.
Latter, I intend to developer some chatrooms and marketplaces, with a user prfile inside this application.

[Access the DroneEnv repository here.](https://github.com/jrdutra/droneenv)

#### SDGC

The SDGC is a private human resource system from the Municipality of MacaÃ©-RJ. It's writen in Java for the backend application and PHP and Javascript for the frontend application. There we also have the JasperServer as a report server that uses the jasperrepots library to generate the reports of the system.
We also have as a infrastructre tool the Docker, where we deploy the backend and the reports server.

#### Free JasperSoftÂ® Studio Course

I am currently developing a free video course of [JasperSoftÂ® Studio](https://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jaspersoft-studio) at the Youtube. The [JasperSoftÂ® Studio](https://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jaspersoft-studio) is a free tool to generate reports with any application. You can visit this course [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLydhlxPpuc-SX4VGw7FaR7-aEkm6dChVh).

## ðŸ”¨Other Projects and Tools

#### OcrPDF

The Ocr PDF is a small tool the read texts in digitalized images inside a PDF document and singles images as jpg and png.
This tool uses the [tesseract](https://opensource.google/projects/tesseract) library to read the texts in the files and saves it on a mysql database, showing up as a very util tool to organize digitalized documents.

[You can find this tool here](https://github.com/jrdutra/OcrPDF)
