#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

##### DroneEnv 

A Flutter application to show the weather forecast for Drone flights. You can access the repository [here](https://github.com/jrdutra/droneenv).
The first stage is to develop the Flutter app for the frontend and latter the backend using the springframework with the Java language.
Latter, I intend to developer some chatrooms and marketplaces, with a user prfile inside this application.
