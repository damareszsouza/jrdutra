## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

#### DroneEnv 

A Flutter application to show the weather forecast for Drone flights. You can access the repository [here](https://github.com/jrdutra/droneenv).
The first stage is to develop the Flutter app for the frontend and latter the backend using the spring framework with the Java language.
Latter, I intend to developer some chatrooms and marketplaces, with a user prfile inside this application.

#### SDGC

The SDGC is a private human resource system from the Municipality of MacaÃ©-RJ. It's writen in Java for the backend application and PHP and Javascript for the frontend application. There we also have the JasperServer as a report server that uses the jasperrepots library to generate the reports of the system.
We also have as a infrastructre tool the Docker, where we deploy the backend and the reports server.
